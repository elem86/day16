🔍 NBA Correlation Heatmap in Python

Today I explored statistical relationships between key NBA performance metrics using a correlation heatmap — a quick and insightful way to uncover patterns in data.

📊 Dataset: NBA Player Stats (from Basketball Reference, post-1973)

🔧 Metrics Analyzed:

  - 2P, FG, 3P, AST, STL, BLK, PTS, ORB, DRB
    

✅ What I Discovered:

  - Strong correlation between Offensive Rebounds (ORB) and Defensive Rebounds (DRB) — rebounding instincts translate across the court.

  - The positive relationship between Steals (STL) and scoring metrics like 2P and 3P highlights that active defenders often create scoring opportunities.


🔥 Correlation heatmaps are one of the best ways to quickly understand how different performance metrics interact in sports (or any domain!).
